# Title: PHP Price Calculator challenge

- Type of Challenge: `Learning challenge`
- Duration: `4 days`
- Deployment strategy : `NA`
- Team challenge : `pairs`

## Learning objectives
- Apply basic OOP principles
- Import data with a database
- Learn to use an MVC

## The Mission
Today you are going to combine your new awesome OOP powers with a database.
To give you some time to get familiar with a database, this exercise only requires read access, not write access.

Make a price calculator with the following entities:
- Customer (Firstname, Lastname)
- A customer group (Name)
- A product (product name, price in cents)

*Notice that the price is in cents stored as an integer, not as a float. This is because you should _never store currency as a float_. The reason for this is that they store the number with unexpected rounding behavior. For example, it will store 5 as 4.999999999999999999 (scientific fraction), making pennies appear and disappear, once you start to do calculations with multiple floats.*

*Don't forget to divide by 100 in your PHP code to show the pennies again!* 

A customer belongs to a customer group, which can also belong to another group (infinite).
You don't need to worry for infinite loops in this exercise.

Both a customer and a group can have a discount, which can be a percentage or a fixed amount. 

#### To calculate the price:
- For the customer group: In case of variable discounts look for highest discount of all the groups the user has.
- If some groups have fixed discounts, count them all up.
- Look which discount (fixed or variable) will give the customer the most value.
- Now look at the discount of the customer.
- First subtract fixed amounts, then percentages!
- A price can never be negative.

### Importing the data
With this exercise you can find an [SQL file](resources/import.sql) you can import into a database, the previous exercise has shown you the command to do this.
If done successfully, will create 3 different tables (Customer, Group, Product) with some data inside it.

### What is an MVC?
MVC is a classic web design pattern consistent of three levels, and is an extension of the principle of **separation of concerns**:

- The **Controller** responds to user actions and invokes changes on the model or view as appropriate.
- The **Model** represents the information on which the application operates--its business logic.
- The **View** renders the model into a web page suitable for interaction with the user.

For now you should create 3 different directories:
- **Controller/**: has access to GET/POST vars, receives the Request
- **Model/**: Most of your code should be here, for example the Product and Customer class.
- **View/**: Your HTML files.

While splitting up the Controller & Model is quite intuitive, splitting up the View from the Controller might require a larger change in how you write code. Let us look at some example:

````php
<?php
//oldcode.php
if($_GET['age'] > 18) {
    echo '<h1>You are an adult!</h1>';
} else {
    echo '<h1>You are a child!</h1>';
}
````

We can split this up into two files:
````php
<?php
//view.php
$sentence = ($_GET['age'] > 18) ? 'You are an adult!' : 'You are a child!';
require 'view.php';
````

````php
<!-- view.php-->
<h1><?php echo $sentence?></h1>
````

## Must-have features
- A dropdown where you can select a Product and a Customer and you get the basic information of the product + the price.
- Use a [MVC pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller). You can use the [MVC Boilerplate](https://github.com/becodeorg/php-mvc-boilerplate).
- Use separate objects for importing the entities with SQL, and for managing the entities.

## Nice to have features
- An actual login page for a customer
- A table where you can see in detail how the price is calculated
- The possibility to have different prices for different quantities (look, 1 EUR per item for 1, 0.9 EUR per item for 100, ...)
- A category page for the different products

### Discussion for friday
- Do you prefer procedural code or object oriented one? Why?
- What is the use of an MVC? Do you prefer another way of structuring your code?
